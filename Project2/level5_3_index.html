<h1>everything in slow motion
 <h1>i calculate the time required
 to move to a place
 I dont want to be
 <h1>yet 

 <h1> I dont want to stay 
 where I am 
 my feet drag
 along the ground
 <h1>kicking
 dust in 
 the air
 dust that chokes me
 <h1>it fills my breath
 <h1>begins to cake in my eyes
 
 <h1>a dark 
 brown mud
 that would blot out the light
 <h1>if there was any
</h1>
