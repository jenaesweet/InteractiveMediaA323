					<div class="poem">everything in slow motion i calculate the time required to move to a place i don't want to be.</div>

					<div class="want">yet I don't want to stay where I am my feet drag along the ground kicking dust in the air.</div>

					<div class="chokes">dust that chokes me it fills my breath begins to cake in my eyes a dark brown mud that would blot out the light if there was any.</div>
