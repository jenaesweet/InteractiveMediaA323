<h1><div><span>Everything in slow motion
 i calculate the time required
 to move to a place
 I dont want to be
 yet I dont 
 want to stay 
 where I am 
 my feet drag
 along the ground
 kicking
 dust in 
the air
 dust that chokes me
 it fills my breath
 begins to cake in my eyes
 a dark 
brown mud
 that would blot out the light
 if there was any</span></div></h1>
